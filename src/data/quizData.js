Understanding the experiment conducted by Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty is crucial for grasping the concept of genetic inheritance.",

Ribose has a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to its 2' carbon, whereas deoxyribose has a hydrogen atom (H) instead. This difference is crucial for the structure and function of RNA and DNA. The presence of the hydroxyl group in ribose makes RNA more reactive and less stable than DNA, which is why DNA is the primary genetic material in most organisms.",
